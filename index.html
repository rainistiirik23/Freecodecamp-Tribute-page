                    <li>Fleming went to Loudoun Moor School and Darvel School, and earned a two-year scholarship to

                    September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's
                    first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did.
